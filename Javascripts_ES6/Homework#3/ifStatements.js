/**
 * ES6 Homework assignment #3 - Statemnets and Operators.
 *
 * This assignment demonstrates using the if statement to derive
 * a logical outcome.
 *
 * Code example 1 is used to evaluate the following logic:
 *
 *    All men are mortal
 *    Socrates is a man.
 *    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
 *
 * Code example 2 evaluates the following logic:
 *
 *    This cake is either vanilla or chocolate.
 *    This cake is not chocolate.
 *    Therefore, this cake is vanilla.
 *
