      <h2>Brazilian Barbecue History</h2>
        <p>
            More than 400 years ago cattle ranching was introduced to the Rio Grande do Sul region of Brazil. 
            Cowboys, called Gauchos, herded these cattle, and like the cowboys of Texas, created a new style of cooking. 
            They called it Churrasco, which is Brazilian barbecue.
            Though this style of barbecue wasn't based on smoke like that of the Southern United States, it has all the traditions and elements of an American barbecue. 
            Churrasco started in the 16th and 17th centuries and spread throughout all of Brazil in the 1940s as the Gauchos spread across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Origin of Churrasco</h3>
            Originally, the standard formula for Brazilian-style barbecue was to coat meats in coarse salt. 
            The meat would then sit for about 30 minutes to absorb the salt and then was placed over the fire. 
            Later a salt-water baste was used to keep meats moist during the cooking. The beef was typically never seasoned. 
            Poultry and lamb, however, are spiced with a rich marinade the night before cooking. Meats are places on long sword-like skewers and cooked over an open fire. 
            Nowadays with the growing popularity of this style of grilling, you can even buy a churrasco grill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Churrasco is much more than a way of cooking in the Rio Grande do Sul—it's a way of life. 
            The barbecue capital of Brazil is the city of Nova Brescia which has a statue of a man cooking barbecue in the central plaza. 
            In the 1940s this city had a population of about 150,000. 
            Since then the population has dropped to about 30,000 due to the mass exodus of people leaving to open barbecue restaurants across Brazil.
        </p>

      <p>
          <h3>Brazilian Barbecue at Home</h3>
          You can experience this at home as well. Kebabs are one of the easiest things to grill. 
          And since the tradition is to place only one kind of meat on each skewer, the problem of different cooking times is then eliminated. 
          The next time you have an army over, try a Brazilian barbecue.

            The top sirloin cap is also known as picanha (pronounced "pee-KAHN-ya")—the specialty of a churrascaria or Brazilian steakhouse. The flavorful meat is skewered, grilled, and sliced before serving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Picanha is not often carried on supermarket shelves, but it is usually available by request at a butcher or good meat counter. It's relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to ribeyes and other notable steaks, and is packed with beef flavor. This makes it one of the best cuts of meat for grilling. Tri-tip and sirloin steaks are often confused with the top sirloin cap, but a knowledgeable butcher will know exactly what you're looking for. 
            Traditionally, picanha is grilled on long skewers, but for the home cook, it will be a lot easier to cut the steak into portions for smaller skewers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't skip resting the steak for the juiciest results. Serve picanha with pão de queijo (cheese bread), garlicky collard greens, and crispy or creamy polenta for a Brazilian feast.

                            Alternatively, heat a charcoal grill until very hot before carefully scraping the coals to the back of the grill. 
                            Immediately add the steak to the front side of the grill.</p>
