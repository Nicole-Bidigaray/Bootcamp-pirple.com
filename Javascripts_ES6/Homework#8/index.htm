<!--
Your assignment is to create a tic-tac-toe game out of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
You should have a single HTML page, one accompanying JS file, and one accompanying CSS file.
1. When the page loads, only the game board should be displayed (draw the game
   board any way you see fit).
2. When a user clicks within the game board (in an empty space) their mark
   (either "X" or "O" should appear there). "X" goes first. So the first valid
   click on the game board should produce an "X". The second should produce an
   "O", and then they should trade off.
3. The "X" s should be red, and the "O"s should be black.
4. If someone wins (gets three in a row), you should make a dialog box appear
   on the screen that says either "X has won!" or "O has won!" And when the
   dialog box is closed, the game should be reset to its beginning state.
5. If all the areas of the board get filled but nobody wins, a dialog box
   appear on the screen that says either "Cats game!" And when the dialog box
   is closed, the game should be reset to its beginning state.
